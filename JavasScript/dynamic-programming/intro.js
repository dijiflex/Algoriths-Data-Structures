Overlapping Sub-problems
Optimal Substructure

A method of solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of 
simpler sub-problems, solving each of those sub-problems just once, and storing their solutions.
Richard Bellman

OVERLAPPING SUB-PROBLEMS
***************************************
A problem is said to have overlapping sub-problems if it can be broken down into sub-problems
which are reused several times.


Example is fibonacci sequence - every number after the first two is the sum of the two previous numbers.
Subproblem: Not overlapping - Merge Sort is an example of a non-overlapping subproblem


OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE -
**********************************88
A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution 
can be constructed from optimal solutions of its sub-problems.
